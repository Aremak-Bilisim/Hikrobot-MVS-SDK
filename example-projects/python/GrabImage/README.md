Camera Frame Capture and Display

1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
This project captures frames from a camera using the MvCamera SDK, processes them (converts from Bayer to RGB), and displays the resized frames in a window. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate real-time image capture and processing from supported camera devices, allowing users to easily visualize the captured frames.

Key Objectives:

1) Capture and process frames from cameras using the MvCamera SDK.
2) Display the captured images in real-time with OpenCV.
3) Implement camera configuration options like Gain and Exposure Time.

Expected Outcomes:

1) Real-time display of resized frames.
2) Seamless capture and processing of images in various formats.
3) Flexible and multi-threaded frame acquisition and display.
